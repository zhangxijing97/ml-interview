## Supervised Learning
A type of machine learning where each training example has both input features **X** and a known output label **y**. The goal is to learn a function \( f: X \rightarrow y \) that can predict labels for new, unseen data.

**Common algorithms:**  
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees / Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
- Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)  
- Neural Networks (for classification/regression)  

## Unsupervised Learning
A type of machine learning where the data has only input features **X**, but no labels **y**. The goal is to find hidden patterns, structures, or groupings in the data.

**Common algorithms:**  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Hierarchical Clustering  
- DBSCAN  
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Independent Component Analysis (ICA)  
- Autoencoders  
- t-SNE / UMAP
